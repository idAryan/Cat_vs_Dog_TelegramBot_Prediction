## üîç Project Overview

Simple Cat vs Dog Classification. Whenever user sends a Photo to the telegram, it predicts using trained model and replies back

##  Model Architecture

The model is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained from scratch using the [Dogs vs Cats dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765).  
Frameworks used:
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib for EDA
- OpenCV for preprocessing
